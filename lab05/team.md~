- We are going to be coding in pairs and breaking up the work like in iteration 1. 
- However, we are going to be interacting a lot more with each other as there is a lot more crossover and in order for there to be no conflicts or outstanding errors. 
- An example would be like if for one function we used a dict and in another function that calls on the first one its decided to use a list, there would be conflict. Which is why we decide to check in after we do a function with the other half of the group.
- Working in pairs means that we can bounce ideas and will be easier to find issues if we gave multiple eyes going over code.
- Also, we will be going over our iteration 1 tests, editing them to fix what went wrong in iteration 1.
- We are also going to increase the frequency of online meetups.
